- 123 -> x means that the signal 123 is provided to wire x.


- x AND y -> z means that the bitwise AND of wire x and wire y is provided to wire z.


- p LSHIFT 2 -> q means that the value from wire p is left-shifted by 2 and then provided to wire q.


- NOT e -> f means that the bitwise comple­ment of the value from wire e is provided to wire f.
